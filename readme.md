# Object Detection Web Application
The application uses AI model to detect objects in images and videos. The only file type supported so far is JPG for images and MP4 for videos. 

I used Flask for the backend of the application and TensorFlow open source <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection">Object Detection API</a> for developing my model.
